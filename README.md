Shopkeeper-Accounting
=================

The project is meant to maintain the daily purchase and sale with stock  
scalability and code- reusability in mind, which means that the same project can be altered. Some features are 
=> Design template has been taken from a free bootstrap template
=> complete project is inside Admin folder
=> datbase is available in database folder
=> to start with login browse through 'localhost/shopkeeper_accounting/admin'
=> Admin and other users login with different access roles
=> manage Category wise product records
=> manage Supplier and Customer reocrds
=> manage purchase and sale (edit purchase and sale are not available)
=> manage stock
=> manage users


The complete code has been done in 2 days only, so there may be issue of understanding the code by other programmers. There are many options may be added/modified with correct planning if more time is given to project.
